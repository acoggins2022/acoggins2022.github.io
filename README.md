## About This Project

This portfolio was built from scratch and has evolved from a simple single-page resume into a comprehensive, modern web showcase. The goal was to create a clean, professional, and interactive platform that not only lists my skills but actively demonstrates them through detailed project case studies and hands-on web applications.

## Site Structure

The website is organized into a multi-page "hub and spoke" model:

* **Homepage (`index.html`):** A central landing page providing a high-level overview of my background, education, key skills, and summaries of my main projects with enhanced hero section and call-to-action buttons.
* **Project Case Study Pages:**
    * `project-navigation.html`: A deep dive into the AWS-based Indoor Navigation System project.
    * `project-planner.html`: A detailed look at the Java Daily Planner desktop application.
    * `project-compressor.html`: A showcase of my personal Video Compressor GUI project.
* **Interactive Playground (`playground.html`):** A page featuring hands-on web applications including a statistical calculator, Tic-Tac-Toe game, and ChoiceGrid decision-making tool.
