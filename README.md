## About This Project

This portfolio was built from scratch and has evolved from a simple single-page resume into a multi-page showcase. The goal was to create a clean, professional, and interactive platform to not only list my skills but to actively demonstrate them through detailed project case studies and interactive web applications.

## Site Structure

The website is organized into a multi-page "hub and spoke" model:

* **Homepage (`index.html`):** A central landing page providing a high-level overview of my background, education, key skills, and summaries of my main projects.
* **Project Case Study Pages:**
    * `project-navigation.html`: A deep dive into the AWS-based Indoor Navigation System project.
    * `project-planner.html`: A detailed look at the Java Daily Planner desktop application.
    * `project-compressor.html`: A showcase of my personal Video Compressor GUI project.
* **Interactive Playground (`playground.html`):** A page featuring small, hands-on web applications I've built, including a statistical calculator and a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Technologies Used

* **Front-End:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **Design & Layout:** Modern CSS with Flexbox and Grid for a fully responsive design.
* **Interactivity:** JavaScript's Intersection Observer API for smooth scroll-fade animations and DOM manipulation for the interactive playground apps.
* **Hosting:** Deployed as a static site on GitHub Pages.

## Key Features

* **Multi-Page Architecture:** Organizes content logically, allowing for both quick overviews and detailed deep dives.
* **Detailed Project Case Studies:** Each major project has its own page with problem statements, my specific contributions, architectural diagrams (UML/ERD), and screenshots.
* **Interactive Skill Demonstrations:** The "Playground" page provides live, hands-on examples of my coding abilities.
* **Professional UI/UX:** Features a sticky navigation bar for easy site-wide navigation, a prominent resume download button, and a clean, consistent design aesthetic.
* **Fully Responsive:** The layout is designed to work seamlessly on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
